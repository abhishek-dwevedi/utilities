[DRAFT]

Maven is a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:

* Builds
* Documentation
* Reporting
* Dependencies
* SCMs
* Releases
* Distribution

groupId is the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project
artifact Id is unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project


Maven Phases

Most common default lifecycle phases executed.

validate: validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile: compile the source code of the project
test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package: take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run
verify: run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
install: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy: done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

Other useful
clean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds
site: generates site documentation for this project



The Reactor
The mechanism in Maven that handles multi-module projects is referred to as the reactor. This part of the Maven core does the following:

Collects all the available modules to build
Sorts the projects into the correct build order
Builds the selected projects in orde

Useful commands
mvn clean install -o  /* Use offline files for build
